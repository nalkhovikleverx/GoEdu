# Problem Domain
Online Consultation Marketplace is a platform connecting consultants with those seeking consultations. It lists various consultants along with their expertise, ratings, and other details, making it easy for users to find the right consultant for their needs. Users simply sign up and find the appropriate consultant to help solve their problem.

### As a Consultant

* List your expertise and provide relevant certification
* The profile approval request is sent to the admin. Once approved, the consultant can mark their availability on the calendar to receive session bookings
* Upon receiving a booking, the consultant can start the session at the scheduled time or request the client to reschedule

### As a Consultation Seeker

* Use the search bar to find a consultant suited to your needs
* Book an online consultation

# Core Features
Our educational project will include only two key features:

* Session Scheduling: The platform should allow scheduling of appointments to handle increased consultation bookings. This helps consultants manage their time efficiently and offer timely consultations.
* Advanced Search: The search functionality enables clients to find consultants by entering their preferences, enhancing user experience and increasing time spent on the platform.
